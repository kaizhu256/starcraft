---===Installation Notes===---
1)Unpack the archive using your favourite program...
2)...and that's it! Run the EXE and enjoy! :)


---===Usage Notes===---
1)You can move both the executable (DatEdit.exe), the libraries (DLL files) the config file ("DatEdit.ini") and the data folders ("Data", "Default" and "Formats") wherever you want - this is no problem as long as they are together.DO NOT separate them, as this will result in DatEdit refusing to work properly. 

2)The content of the "Data" folder are just text listfiles. They are used for the listings that appear in the drop-down boxes when you run the program. Feel free to edit these text files but unless you REALLY know what you're doing I advise that you leave them the way they are. DO NOT remove any file from the "Data" folder. The result may be the same as above.


---===FOREWORD===---

The application that you just put your hands on, DatEdit, is a *.DAT files editor. These files are the major data files used in the award-winning Blizzard RTS game Starcraft and they control multiple different properties, ranging from units&weapons statistics (health points, movement, damage, targeting), through display-related stuff (unit graphics, palette setting, animations used), to end with certain AI-related options.
Thus, editing DAT files gives you a chance to create your own original StarCraft customs for other people to share with and have more fun with the game. And this was the main reason why DatEdit was created: to allow YOU to turn your ideas into a good and entertaining product, that someone else can download and say:

"Hey, this kicks ass!!!"

---===WHY DATEDIT?===---

When compared to the previously available modding tools (such as Arsenal3 or Arsenal Zero), it may seem that DatEdit is not a breakthrough achievement. You can take Arsenal3 and say: "The GUI is almost the same - why should I switch over to DatEdit?". You can take Arsenal Zero and say: "I can get the same results with AZ, why should I even bother trying DatEdit?"

You're right in saying that DatEdit may not make you jump out of your shoes, however it is an improvement large enough over the other tools to be worth using. And here's why:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-DatEdit has a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Although we all love Arsenal Zero, editing raw text files may get tedious at times. DatEdit has a clear and straightforward interface that allows quick and easy editing of the desired DAT properties without scrolling and using the Find function all the time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2-DatEdit has updated listfiles for all DAT files.
"Hmm...Unknown85 points to Unknown465 which points to Unkno...." - In DatEdit this is no more!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-DatEdit has full format support.
When compared to Arsenal3, and even AZero, DatEdit has many of the "Unknown" properties researched and properly labeled (with many thanks going here to DiscipleOfAdun and Ojan for doing this). For more, some of them are present only for certain specific entries (and for all of them), and this is perfectly reflected in the program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4-DatEdit does not corrupt files.
While this may not sound to be some great advantage, play with Arsenal3's Images Editor a bit and you'll see what it means (No offense KA, really). =)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5-DatEdit is virtually bugless.
I say "virtually", because you never know, however at its current stage of development DatEdit is almost 100% stable. For more, feel free to report any bugs that you find, and they will certainly be addressed and hopefully, fixed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6-DatEdit's source code is publicly available.
While this is a completely different story, you are free to download and look into the source code of this program for your own educational purposes. No profit can be generated from it however, as it is supposed to be free to everyone.


---===LAST WORD===---

If you want to send comments, feedback, opinions, ideas for new features (most welcome!) or any other forms of constructive criticism, then feel free to do it. Just one thing: please, DO NOT ask "how DatEdit works" or anything similar. There are enough people, forums and tutorials around the web to educate a whole galaxy of modding newcomers, so I personally feel relieved from this obligation :D

See ya making great mods with DatEd!
