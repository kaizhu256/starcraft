scloader2b: no-cd BNET loader for all versions of Original StarCraft and BroodWar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Extract scloader2b.exe to your StarCraft directory.

2) Launch scloader2b.exe and play! With scloader2b you will be able to play single player
   custom games and multiplayer games without CD in the drive, but there is no music, movies,
   and campaigns. Of course you will be able to install these features from your StarCraft
   and BroodWar CDs to your hard drive.


scloader2b command-line parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   usage: scloader2b [scloader2b_parameters] [starcraft_parameters]

 * scloader2b_parameters:

   -primarydir <dir>     Instructs scloader2b to start searching install.exe in the <dir> folder
                         before all other possible locations.

   -nocdcheck            Scloader2b won't search for the install.exe file in your CD drives.

   -noscdir              StarCraft will not search your StarCraft installation directory and its
                         subfolder called BW for the install.exe data file.

   -noembedinstall       Keeps StarCraft from loading data from scloader2b itself instead of
                         another install.exe file.

   -mpq <mpq>            Load an MPQ mod into StarCraft or StarEdit. You can specify more than
                         one -mpq parameter to load as many MPQ mod files as you want. The first
                         specified MPQ file will have the highest priority. Do not use this
                         parameter when you play on BNET.

   -/+dll <dll>          Load a DLL into StarCraft or StarEdit. Use as many -/+dll parameters as
                         you want. Use -dll to specify a startup DLL and use +dll for non-startup
                         DLLs. Startup DLLs are loaded after the main thread reached the entrypoint
                         of starcraft.exe, and nonstartups are loaded after sc created the main
                         window and the directdraw objects and passed it to storm.dll.
                         DLLs will be loaded in the same order as you specified them on the command
                         line, but they will be unloaded in reverse order before StarCraft exits.
                         It is logical that the startup DLLs will be loaded before all nonstartups,
                         but the unloading will be done in reverse order.
                         Don't use this parameter unless you know what you are doing.

   -/+xmod <xmod>        Load an XMOD plugin into StarCraft. Use of an XMOD file is similar to the
                         use of a simple DLL.

   -nowarn               Don't show error message when StarCraft fails to load a DLL/MPQ file and
                         continue loading StarCraft.
                         This parameter won't disable error messages about non-existing or damaged
                         DLL/MPQ files that were caught before we loaded StarCraft.

   -staredit             Launch staredit.exe instead of starcraft.exe. This parameter is useful when
                         you wanna load your dll and mpq files to staredit to build a map for your mod.
                         You should use only the -mpq, -/+dll, -/+xmod, and -nowarn parameters with the
                         -staredit switch, because all other parameters will be ignored.

   -?, -help             Show a help window with brief description about these parameters.


Notice:
~~~~~~~
 - The <dir>, <mpq>, and <dll> parameters can be full path names, for example:

       \my_mpq_files\mpq1.mpq
       c:\mods\mpq2.mpq

 - Unless you specify a full path name, it is always relative to your StarCraft installation
   directory:

       my_mpq_files\mpq1.mpq           -> it means: sc_installdir\my_mpq_files\mpq1.mpq
       x\                              -> means:    sc_installdir\x\


 - How to use scloader2b on the command line:

   scloader2b -mpq mod1.mpq -noscdir -mpq mod2.mpq

   This will start StarCraft and load 2 MPQ mod files into it. Install exe won't be searched
   in the StarCraft and StarCraft\BW folders (-noscdir parameter).
   mod1.mpq will have higher priority than mod2.mpq, so if both MPQ archives contain 1-1 file
   with the same name, StarCraft will it from mod1.mpq.
   scloader2b.exe should always be in your StarCraft directory!!!


Good to know:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - You don't need the CDs and can play on BattleNET too if you installed Starcraft using a
   valid BattleNet cd-key. Note that this loader isn't a BattleNet cd-key crack! CD key
   authentication can't be passed when you log on BNET. Don't install StarCraft to your mate's
   machine using your original sc cd-key, and don't copy your sc to his machine if you istalled
   that game with your cd-key cause the key is encrypted into one of the StarCraft data files,
   so they may steal it and one key can only be used only by one person on BNET at the same time!!!

 - Where does StarCraft search for the install.exe file(s) using this loader when you start the
   game or change form Original StarCraft to BroodWar or vice versa in the main menu???
     1) The directory sepcified using the -primarydir parameter of scloader2b.
        This step will skipped if you don't use the -primarydir parameter.
        If no suitable install.exe found then...
     2) Starcraft tries to load install.exe from the root directories of your CD-ROM drives.
        The check of the CD drives can be skipped using the -nocdcheck parameter.
     3) If install.exe is not found yet, StarCraft tries to load it from your StarCraft installation
        directory (where starcraft.exe is located) and from a subdir called "BW" located in your
        installation directory. You can keep scloader2b from searching these directories using
        the -noscdir parameter.
     4) StarCraft still did not find the proper install.exe, so it will load the data found in
        scloader2b itself. You can avoid this using the -noembedinstall parameter. Once StarCraft
        loaded the scloader2b-embedded data, the above locations are out of use until you restart
        StarCraft.

 - Notice:
   ~~~~~~~
     1) If you wanna play campaigns, listen to sc music, watch the movies during the game:
        Insert a CD containing another (full) install.exe file before launching starcraft, then this
        file will be loaded instead of the ripped, cause starcraft searches the cd-rom drives before
        all other locations (except the directory specified with the -primarydir parameter).
        You can also use the -primarydir parameter to load an install.exe file of your choice from
        any directory on your machine. Full installation of starcraft and broodwar is also possible.
        Just copy the install.exe file from the StarCraft CD into your StarCraft directory. If you
        wanna full BroodWar installation then create a subfolder called BW in the StarCraft directory
        and copy the install.exe from the BroodWar CD here. It isn't needed to make a full installation
        of both StarCraft and BroodWar.

     2) If you use the no-cd loader and the game runs properly without CD, but you are still unable to
        connect to BNET then it isn't the failure of the loader. It's sure that you cant log on BNET
        even you run the game without this prog, it may be the weakness of your internet connection
        or something else... I can only recommend you to browse Blizzard's website for technical help.

     3) After installing a new patch, the patcher will automatically launch starcraft.exe instead of
        scloader2b.exe and you will get a popup window asking for the CD. Just close this window and
        happily restart StarCraft with scloader2b.exe, cause it has very good chances to work with
        future StarCraft patches. :)

If you have problems with the loader feel free to mail me and send some details about the error.
I can not repair errors when I know only that "It does not work for me...".


A recent release of scloader2b contains a bug that prevents loading the internal install.exe data of
scloader2b when you use it with some of the non-english versions of StarCraft. For example the
French versions refused to load install.exe data from scloader2b. This means that you have to put an
install.exe in your StarCraft folder if you use that buggy version of scloader2b for example with
French StarCraft versions. The bug is fixed in this release.


Good gaming! ^^
